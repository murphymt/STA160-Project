Entering the job market is intimidating to many job seekers and newly graduated college students. It does not have to be this way. Our goal is to provide job seekers knowledge they can use to make job seekers more competitive. When someone is searching for an employment opportunity, they take into account the industry, company, duties, salary, location, and many other features. The purpose of this project is to gather, explore, and analyze job listing data to provide job seekers with insight on the skills required for a full-time data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, and business intelligence positions across the United States. Our team decided to collect data by scraping job postings from the Cybercoder and the Simplyhired. Through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining (TM) methods, we obtained insights and recognized patterns that are unknown to the typical job seeker. We took a particular interest in the skill-set information as well as salary estimates provided by the job websites and then related our findings to geographic regions by comparing and contrasting skill requirements in different states, cities, and broader areas such as the east and west coast.
