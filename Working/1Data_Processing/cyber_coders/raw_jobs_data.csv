We are working to create cutting edge NLP engines that are able to manage live catalogs of incident resolution and service response recipes.  We are looking to add the best and brightest to our team!!What You Will Be DoingWe are building a product that helps customers fulfill service requests as well as troubleshoot and diagnose infrastructure issues that cut across domains. The product needs to collect, collate andanalyze logs, telemetry and monitoring data emanating from multi-vendor and multi-datacenter/cloud systems. The analysis should help with timestamp based correlation of events across systems, extraction of inferences derived from performance counters from multiplesystems and trace the sequence of events across layers of the datacenter stack.We are looking to hire an engineering technical leader with deep systems knowledge. The role entails a deeper understanding of how data center systems operate requiring familiarity with compute, storage, networking and virtualization products. Think Dtrace but with a scope that spans across systems and not just within a system. The logs infrastructure needs to scale horizontally and enable machine learning models to learn systems behavior. Over time, the learning translates to automatic application of resolutions and thereby reducing human involvement.What You Need for this PositionRequirements: Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related fields-Strong in data structures, algorithms and systems-Deep understanding of systems behavior and and affinity for logs-Experience with building infrastructure to collect, prepare and analyze logs, telemetry and monitoring data-Experience with building and using tools like Dtrace, BTrace, etc.-Experience with log analytics tools like Splunk, ELK, etc.-Knowledge of time series models and use of systems like OpenTSDB, Graphite, etc.-Experience with handling complex production and/or support escalation issues-Heuristic problem solving with incomplete information-Deep domain knowledge and hands-on experience across a very broad spectrum of backend, frontend, cloud, AI and data infrastructure platformsPluses: - Experience with Storm or Spark-Experience with Kafka-Knowledge in one or more of the following data center supportability technologies will be a big plus - networking (e.g. L2/L5 load balancer, routers/switches, Software DefinedNetwork), storage (e.g. NAS/iSCSI/SAN configuration), supportability (e.g. incidentmanagement, systems diagnostics).What's In It for You- Competitive Salary- Join at the beginning of a well funded Team- Immediate Hire- Equity optionsSo, if you are a Senior Data Engineer with experience, please apply today!

Business Analyst,Junior Account Executive,"Boston, MA",[],"If you want to accelerate your career growth, you need to stop thinking about the day one stuff. Instead, think year one, and beyond.For example, consider this position we're working on. It involves a smaller-sized and explosively growing Boston-based Research and Market Intel client that asked us to find them a Junior Account Executive and help them become as big as their dreams. As a result, you will, too! That's the stuff beyond year one. If you're interested, here's what year one is all about. For a salesperson, this is the stuff of dreams - getting out and selling a world-class product and making a difference.1) Identify, prospect, target, and close new business.2) Build a strong book of business in your local territory.3) Work closely with the solution and technology team to ensure customer objectives are met.4) Build and orchestrate sales pipeline activity. 5) Ensures active nurturing of deals and movement of opportunities to closure.Realistically, we need someone with 2 to 3 years experience selling Research, Security, Infrastructure, SCM, or ERP to Fortune 1000 clients (you don't learn these things overnight). Coming from a competitor of ours would add a lot of credibilities?. Most important is a hands-on understanding of the complexities of selling. Also important is the aggressiveness and ambition to hunt for new business. If you pull all of this off, the VP of Sales will be thanking you!While this is all of the Year One and Beyond Stuff, Day One is pretty good, too.

However, none of this matters unless ""Year One and Beyond"" makes career sense for you.The best Account Executives are knowledgeable, passionate, and multi-functional. They have the ability to sell directly to VP and C-level executives. They know the IT marketplace inside and out.
